# CMB Analysis Project Overview
This is a WIP project on understaning the process behind cleaning/processing CMB images. The goal is to better understand the CMB, the instruments used to create these images, and how to make them look pretty. As of now it just imports already clean images and displays them...

# Theory (not finished)
To better understand each aspect of this project, I've done research on the cosmic microwave background and its notable anisotropies.

## What is the cosmic microwave background?
The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is the oldest detectable light in the universe. It is a near uniform glow of blackbody thermal radiation, which is detectable from all directions. It dates back to around 380,000 years after the Big Bang, when the universe first became transparent.

## Timeline Pre-CMB

### Super Hot Epoch
For a long time after the Big Bang, the universe was an extremely hot and dense plasma. It was so hot that light and matter were inseperable. As the universe expanded and cooled, particles such as electrons and nuclei began to form. Photons at this time were constantly scattered off of free electrons.

### Fluctuations
Although, the temperature was still too high for stable atoms to exist. Instead, the universe remained a giant glob of plasma. Particles raced around at very high speeds, colliding and breaking apart. But within all this chaos was tiny gravitational fluctuations which rippled throughout the plasma. These very minor irregularities would later be the foundation of cosmic structure.

### The Epoch of Recombination
This epoch begain when the early universe became cool enough to support electrons and protons combining to form electrically neutral hydrogen atoms. Since light was no longer being scattered by free electrons, photons could freely travel across space. The universe was finally transparent and the light being emitted right before this time (redshifted to to microwave radiation) is now what we know as the cosmic microwave background.

## How did we discover the CMB?
The CMB was first detected in 1964 by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson. They detected a persistent microwave "noise" in their Holmel Horn Antena. After removing every single other possible source, they realized these signals matched predictions from Big Bang cosmology. At the time, it was believed that this signal was uniform since the equipment could not resolve the small fluctuations of the CMB.

## Anisotrophies

### What is an anisotrophy?
An anisotrophies are tiny temperature fluctuation in the CMB which are on the order of microkelvin.

### The Cold Spot

### Hawking Points
